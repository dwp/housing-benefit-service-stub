# Housing Benefit Service Stub

A very basic stub for the Housing Benefit External API. 

This stub allows those integrating with the Housing Benefit External API to test the validity of their requests.

Unfortunately due to limitation of the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/), there is no validation of the HTTP request headers.

Note that the error responses generated by this stub do not match those generated by the real service. See the specification of the format of error responses.

## Requirements

This stub requires [Java 11](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/).

## Usage

Start stub with `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

To check that your application is running enter url [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health).

### Example requests

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "correlationId: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012" \
